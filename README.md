#  Grade Management System

##  Project Overview

The Grade Management System is a Java-based console application designed to manage and analyze student academic performance. The project follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and uses ArrayList for dynamic data storage.

The system allows users to:
- Add student names and subject marks
- Validate marks (0–100 range)
- Calculate averages automatically
- Assign grades (A+, A, B, C, D, F)
- Sort students by performance using Bubble Sort
- Save student data to a file for persistence

This project demonstrates core Java concepts including OOP, Collections Framework, file handling, and algorithm implementation.
